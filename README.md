## Description
`Vulnerability Scanner` is a Python script designed to identify security vulnerabilities in user-provided URLs and credentials. The tool can detect various issues such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), directory traversal, weak passwords, and more. It is a great starting point for security testing and vulnerability assessment of web applications.

## Features
- **URL Input Validation:** Ensures URLs are in the correct format (`http://` or `https://`).
- **Credential Input Validation:** Verifies that credentials are in the correct `username:password` format.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identifies vulnerabilities such as:
  - Insecure protocols (`HTTP` instead of `HTTPS`)
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Open directory listings
  - Sensitive data exposure
  - Directory traversal
  - Unrestricted file uploads
  - Command injection
  - Weak passwords
  - Default credentials
- **Interactive Prompts:** Guides the user through the process of entering URLs and credentials.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vulnerability-scanner.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install re
   ```

## Usage
To use the `Vulnerability Scanner`, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```sh
   python vulnerability_scanner.py
   ```

2. **Enter URLs:**  
   Provide the URLs of the websites you want to scan, separated by commas.

3. **Enter Credentials:**
   Provide credentials in the format `username:password`, separated by commas.

4. **View Results:**  
   The script will scan the URLs and credentials for vulnerabilities and display the results.

### Example Usage:

```bash
Enter the URLs separated by commas (HTTP:// instead of HTTPS://): http://example.com, http://testsite.com
Enter credentials in format 'username:password' separated by commas: admin:admin, user:password
```

## Example Output

```
Insecure Protocols (HTTP instead of HTTPS):
- http://example.com
- http://testsite.com

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Advanced Vulnerability Detection**
   - **Description**: Improve detection algorithms for more complex vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution or advanced XSS techniques.
   - **Benefit**: Provides more thorough security analysis.

### 2. **Integration with Web Vulnerability Databases**
   - **Description**: Cross-check detected vulnerabilities with known security issues in public databases like CVEs.
   - **Benefit**: Helps identify known exploits and their severity.

### 3. **Reporting and Logging**
   - **Description**: Generate detailed reports and logs of the scan results.
   - **Benefit**: Enables easier review and documentation of vulnerability assessments.

### 4. **Automated Scanning of Multiple Sites**
   - **Description**: Add support for scanning multiple sites asynchronously.
   - **Benefit**: Increases the efficiency of scanning large numbers of URLs.

### 5. **GUI Integration**
   - **Description**: Develop a graphical user interface for easier interaction with the script.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a more user-friendly experience for managing vulnerability scans.
